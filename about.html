				<p>A simple game where you have to guess a number between 1 to 999 which is randomly generated by computer,
				if your number matches with the hidden number then you will win.</p>
				<span class="aboutlevel">Level 1</span><p>In level 1 you can guess the number as many times as you can and the computer
				will guide you to find the hidden number by letting you know if the number you have entered is smaller or greater than the hidden number.</p>
				<span class="aboutlevel">Level 2</span><p>In level 2 you will get only 10 chance to find that hidden number, if you fail to do so then you will loose and new game will start with new hidden number.</p>
